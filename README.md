# Gradio Lite Testing Repository

## Overview

This repository serves as a testing ground for experimenting with Gradio Lite, a simplified version of the Gradio library for easy prototyping of machine learning models with minimal code.

## Features

- **Object Detection**: Implementations and examples of object detection models using Gradio Lite.
- **Speech Recognition**: Demonstrations of speech recognition models integrated with Gradio Lite.
- **Speech To Text**: Demonstrations of speech to with a different model models integrated with Gradio Lite.

## Usage

### Object Detection

To test object detection models:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/labknowledge/gradio.git
